- 👋 Hi, My name is Karan Mehta and my handle is @mehtakaran9
- 👀 I’m interested in working with projects that challenge real life problems and can address issues that are prevalent in today's world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about creating new frameworks that can help resolve issues with DevOps and DevEx.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java based projects (or any project really.. doesn't matter), it would be great to catch up and discuss more.
